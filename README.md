<h1> About me </h1>
<p>A university project analyzing F1-Data using a linear regression model </p>
<h4>The project was based on the following questions:</h4>
<p> - What factors in F1 races have the biggest impact on race positioning (Circuit, Driver, Pittimes etc.)?</p>
<p> - How can Teams optimize race positioning?</p>
<p> - Can regression models and predictions be used to beat betting quotes?</p>
